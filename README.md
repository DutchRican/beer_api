# simple beer api

This is just me trying to learn some Go and creating a small API to retrieve beer information.

## create .env file in root with the following information:

-   PORT: `Port number for the service`
-   USERNAME: `Username for postgres`
-   PASSWORD: `Password for postgres`
-   DB_NAME: `name for the postgres database`
-   DB_PORT: `Port number for postgres`
- 	HOST: `Host for postgres e.g. localhost`

## how to run?

Make sure you have Docker and docker-compose installed.
Run `docker-compose up`
